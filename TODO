look at BFW code

have SA - Learn and SA - Evaluate Param panels
		

**spawn spec in spawn point has destination field
**spawn spec gen has destination selector field i.e there is a dest sel class

vehicalDriver view is the vehical's interface to the driver 
driver actions
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.setTargetVelocityWithMaxAccel(double)
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.coast()
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.slowToStop() break??
	
	Steering, acceleration, and breaking:
	
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.SteeringMovement.setSteeringAngleWithBound(double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.setAccelerationWithBound(double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.coast()
	
	Movement: 
	
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.SteeringMovement.move(double, double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.move(double, double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.moveWithoutAcceleration(double, double) //?
	
for sensing

	
	aim4.driver.AutoDriver.intersects(AutoVehicleDriverView, Area)
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.gaugeShape()
	
-------------------------
aim4.util.GeomMath.findLineLineIntersection(Line2D, Line2D)

add param - individuals per generation
add parm - stratagies per generation

	params

**turbo mode
**viewer.resetSimProcess()

	todo

1)	get sim1 to end

2)  write gen1 s1 rulesA

bypass setup screen on all but first sim run
	press start to begin full learning run

	have start call learning harness

avoid xml
	get params from setup class and prev rules from generation
	plaintext records

for each strat in gen
	generate rand rule set
	--> before.txt
