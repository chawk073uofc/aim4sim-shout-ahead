Make ShoutAheadDriver extends Driver??? extends AutoDriver?
	each driver has rule sets
	in SADriver.act() implement the logic of choosing the applicable rule with highest weight
	**remember there are communicating and non-communicating drivers (agents)

make ShoutAheadSimulator implements Simulator? extends AutoDriverOnlySim?
	differences between AutoDriverOnlySim and SA sim:
		don't spawn new cars on each time step - only spawn once
		when spawning, create SADriver objects to associate with each car
		
		Goal: make an AIM sim that spawns once and exits when all cars have reached their dest's
