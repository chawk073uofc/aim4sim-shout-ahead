look at BFW code

have SA - Learn and SA - Evaluate Param panels
		

**spawn spec in spawn point has destination field
**spawn spec gen has destination selector field i.e there is a dest sel class

vehicalDriver view is the vehical's interface to the driver 
driver actions
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.setTargetVelocityWithMaxAccel(double)
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.coast()
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.slowToStop() break??
	
	Steering, acceleration, and breaking:
	
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.SteeringMovement.setSteeringAngleWithBound(double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.setAccelerationWithBound(double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.coast()
	
	Movement: 
	
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.SteeringMovement.move(double, double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.move(double, double)
	aim4.vehicle.BasicVehicle.PhysicalMovement.moveWithoutAcceleration(double, double) //?
	
for sensing

	
	aim4.driver.AutoDriver.intersects(AutoVehicleDriverView, Area)
	aim4.vehicle.VehicleDriverView.gaugeShape()
