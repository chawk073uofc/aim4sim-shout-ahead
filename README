This README is for a version of the AIM4 traffic simulator that was modified in order to carry out a research project in machine learning. For the README for the
original traffic simulator, see AIM4_README.txt.

Downloading and Running the Program Using Eclipse:

	1)	Clone this repository.
	2)	

Using the Simulator:

	This traffic simulation program includes 4 modes that can be used to evaluate 4 different ways of routing traffic through an intersection. 
	These include the three that were included by the authors of the original simulator 
		
		1)	Traffic Lights
		2)	Stop Signs
		3)  Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) protocol
		
	and one that was added to facilitate machine learning of necessary driving behaveiours through a learning method that is a hybrid of reenforcement and evolutionary learning
	
		4) Shout Ahead
		
	To be able to access all simulation modes set aim4.config.Debug.SHOUT_AHEAD_FAST_DEBUG_MODE to FALSE, run the program, select one of the four simulation modes, choose simulation parameters, and click "run".
	To start full machine learning run, where all simulation and learning parameters are taken from aim4.ShoutAheadAI.ShoutAheadSimSetup, set the same flag to TRUE and run the program. Multiple simulations are
	automatically run one after the other until the last simulation of the last generation is reached. 

Understanding the code:

	To see how the learning works see 
	
	aim4.ShoutAheadAI.LearningRun 
	
	and to see how an individual simulation works see 
	
	aim4.ShoutAheadAI.ShoutAheadSimulator.step(double).
